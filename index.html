              <p>Our beef is responsibly sourced from select Western ranches. Good for the environment, nah, in fact raising beef is one of the worst things for the planet. But hey, this meat is so tender and bloody it's worth the 2500 gallons of water needed per pound!</p>

              <p>The South will rise again! In the meantime we will continue to purchase pig parts from North Carolina, the state that butchers more hogs than any other. Bacon is everyone's favorite meat. Even devout vegans ask what's cookin' when bacon's on the grill.</p>

              <p>Nobody does mega-poultry quite like the midwest. Our suppliers go above and beyond the minimum recommended dosages of both antibiotics and growth hormones. These cluckers have such big, juicy breasts they can barely stand up on their own, in fact, some of them can't!</p>
